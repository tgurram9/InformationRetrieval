Don't want to get all bluh bluh with my personal situation, but.  tl;dr, got laid off recently and cash is tight like spandex at the gym.  Things lately have kind of felt like this:  http://i.imgur.com/mimsY.gif

I'm in Redmond, just added Seattle since some people aren't familiar with the area.  Pizza Hut or Papa John's preferred.
