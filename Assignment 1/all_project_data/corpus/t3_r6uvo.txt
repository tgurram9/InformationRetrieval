~~Title basically says it all. Unexpectedly lost my job at the end of January. I interviewed and got a new job around Feb 14-15, but didn't start until March 8th. Only just barely had enough to cover rent, bills, and a few~~ ~~groceries. I'll get my first check Friday morning, but I've been eating ramen for the last week and would really~~ ~~love some cheesy goodness.~~

~~Thanks in advance!~~
