Hello! I was laid off about 3 months ago, and haven't been able to find a job since. For 4-5ish months(maybe alittle less) my fiance had been hit by a truck and was out of work for that long. She has been back to work for about 2 months so we've been just getting by on payments. We had to take a loan out to pay for car issues and since I haven't been able to find a job, our bills are being paid late every month until we can finish paying this loan off. It's been fairly depressing, and I can see it affecting her and our relationship quite a bit. I hurt my back not long ago and have been in PT getting it fixed up. 
So my job searching hasn't been the best, they thought I would have to have surgery, now were working on just getting it to be anon pinched nerve so I can actually move more. We don't argue about money/food a lot, but I know it is affecting her and making her stressed.. And it hurts me to see it.

Anyways. In my fridge is milk and yogurt. Rice and frozen veggies is in the freezer(Rice in cabinet).. And we've basically been eating Ramen or rice for the past few weeks as we haven't gone shopping in a long time. It's her 2 days off starting today and if, out of the generosity of reddit users we could get 1 or 2 pizzas(2 would be optimum for left overs for the next dinner, but 1 is fine) I will gladly gift, post pictures, and even send you a thank you letter/upvote you for life.

I have these:
HL2,HL2:ep1,Portal,Magicka:vietnam
Edit: I also have some Wii games(and GC games as I've been trying to sell it all for money). Mario galaxy 2, mario bros wii, and a ton of GC games. Paper mario, luigis mansion, zelda, the good stuff. 

I also have Reddit friends that could confirm what I've said above^ So I don't look like some random dude just wanting free food. Thanks for consideration.
