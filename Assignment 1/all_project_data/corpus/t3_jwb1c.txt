Hey guys, I just fasted for 5 days for the Hunger Unity for East Africa fundraiser here http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=224652260904169 if you wanted to check it out.

All i had for the last 5 days is 3 V8's and a Herbal Tea (so i didn't die and kept my strength up)

Now that it's over, i'd love a fresh pizza. If someone would be so kind as to email me a card for pizza (pizza hut, dominoes or something) I'd be ever so grateful! Thanks again! Reddit on!

EDIT: Thanks to HOTMAMMA, I live in the USA, just so you guys know!
EDIT: Thanks to SarTim, I pulled my email address, if anyone is kind enough to get me one, post here and i'll PM you my email :)
