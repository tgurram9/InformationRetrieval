I'm currently sitting at work with an empty stomach and an emptier bank account. I'm struggling to stay afloat, but a full docket of bills and college expenses have me running thin this month. I get paid next Friday, and I can give you the promise that I will pay it forward, one way or another.

EDIT: Thanks, mvs5191! You are truly awesome!
