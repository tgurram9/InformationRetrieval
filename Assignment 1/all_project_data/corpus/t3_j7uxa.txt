(A bit of background: I broke my foot in May and since I lived alone at the time and was unable to use the 3 flights of stairs to my apartment, I moved back in with my mum for assisted living, basically--until I can get back on my feet. **I'm still in a effing cast! UGH!**)

ANYWHO, we're leaving this evening to visit my grandma 12 hours away and mum's still running around trying to get everything ready for our trip and as much as she can for when I return home, seven days ahead of her. I'm trying to help where I can, but there isn't much I can do with a broken foot. Having a RAoP delivered (I broke my driving foot) would accomplish a number of things: **1.)**Resolve the issue for the last meal in town. **2.)**Not dirty any dishes for her to wash.  **3.)**Be a way I can "help"/show my appreciation. It's something nice for her and she totally deserves it.

We live in Tennessee and I would be happy to answer any and all questions anyone asked. :)

**EDIT** Request fulfilled!!!! mayquiri rocks my socks!
