I just got back from my first job interview after 6 months of nothing. Feel like celebrating, but ramen and eggs don't make for the best celebratory food. If anyone's feeling generous I would really enjoy a pizza tonight, and of course would pay it forward once I get this job.  

edit: thanks to ftothec!
