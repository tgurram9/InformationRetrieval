I'll send a photo of my driver's license with a "hey &lt;username&gt;" next to it. Just thought a pizza could help with a forever aloneness! Thanks so much to the person who can help me, or just to give me someone to talk to as I take one step closer to death o.0
I live in Virginia - edit

Edit: Thanks for the birthday wishes you guys! Even if i dont get a pizza I really appreciate the support.
