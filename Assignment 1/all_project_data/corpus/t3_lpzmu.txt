Hi!

I'm an recent grad who just moved to Boston to start an independent game studio with two of my friends. Right now we are grinding out flash games [Examples](http://www.bored.com/game/play/151461/Stick_Save.html) to stay ahead of students loans and rent. I don't make much more money than rent here.

I've always heard how awesome and generous this Sub Reddit is, and now I am asking for help!

Help me RAoP your my only hope.

edit: Thank you laneage! :D
