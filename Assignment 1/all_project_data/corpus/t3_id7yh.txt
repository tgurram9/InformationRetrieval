Hi, not something I have done ever, but here it goes.

I got done with my exams 2 weeks ago and wasn't able to work as much as I would have wanted to during this past 30 days, after paying off my rent all my bills, I have just been left enough money for the bus fare to and from work for the next week and I can't spend that, I've got some rice and bread and PB and stuff, but that's only enough to last me a few days, so I was wondering if anyone could buy me a papa johns? That would be a nice fulfilling meal for a change.

Since I get paid in 8 days, i.e next Friday, I promise to pass the pizza love to someone who need's it like I do now, I guess that's the whole point of this subreddit.

Anyway, thanks for reading.
