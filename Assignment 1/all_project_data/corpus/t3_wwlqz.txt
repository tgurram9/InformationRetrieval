I'm a 21 year old college student who lives in Brooklyn, NY.

I'm currently broke and all my relatives are away till Sunday. All I have left is a bit of rice and kielbasa. Probably enough for the rest of today, but I don't know what I'm going to eat tomorrow.

My relatives are in a bit of a bind due to credit issues, so in general we are usually tight on money.

I'm starting work training for my new job next week (worried about talking about it due to NDA issues - similar to another post on Reddit that caused lots of issues for the guy who posted it).

If I could get just a pizza, even plain, the smallest size, it would be nice.

**EDIT** - Thank you [bearvivant](http://www.reddit.com/user/bearvivant) for providing me with a pizza in this time where I'm really down to little! I hope to offer pizza to someone in the future once I get this upcoming job.
