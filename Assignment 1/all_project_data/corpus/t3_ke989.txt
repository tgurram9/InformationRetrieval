**UPDATE: Pizza received and VERY much enjoyed. Thank you so much, Coldheat!**

It's been a long long road to hunger, money's been tight for a few months and we finally hit a wall. Out of Ramen, out of leftover Manwich, even the ice cubes have been vanquished. We have quite the family to feed with two [Guinea](http://i.imgur.com/RIwMP.jpg) [Pigs](http://i.imgur.com/TOBup.jpg) and our beloved [King](http://i.imgur.com/FlkmM.jpg) [Keith](http://i.imgur.com/I3tjM.jpg), and their food took priority this week :/ Will GLADLY repay the tasty favor (to you or another in need) in a few weeks when money gets back on track.  

We're barely 200 pounds put together and a $10 large would feed us for days.  

**TL;DR: Broke couple with well-fed pets needs some pizza in a pinch.**

  EDIT: Third shifters, it is nearing bedtime.
