I know sappy stories are sometimes made-up or used to take advantage of people.  I hate to admit it, but this sappy story is true.  Today, my wife and I lost our youngest cat Tula to liver failure (that is assumed, waiting on the official results).  We rescued her 2 years ago after a fox attack her in the wild.  The vet was going to put her asleep , but my wife, the lover of most living creatures convinced me to take her in.

This week she refused food and eventually last evening passed away.  My wife did get to see her Thursday, but she looked "vacant".  We both agreed we would donate her to the local university for them to perform the autopsy and possibly see what caused her liver to fail.

I am asking for her for some pizza from the reddit community.  This is really for my wife because of the attachment that she had with her.  I can provide verification of Tula and the autopsy (when we get it).  But Pizza and bread sticks would cheer up my wife.

Thanks for at least reading this.  I will pay it forward sometime soon down the road.  

**EDIT**

As promised here are photos of Tula.
