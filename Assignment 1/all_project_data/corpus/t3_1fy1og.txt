Let's be honest, who wants to leave the house with an ace bandage around their head and stitches that look like spiders on their face? 

I had surgery on my neck Tuesday, and my neck and face are covered in bruises. I've managed to stay inside for since then, and hope a few more days will help with the situation. 

I don't mind sending a verification pic of the bruising to any of you kind folks, and hope to return the kindness of yummies sometime soon.

Thank you for taking  the time to look, either way!

Edit: Took the bandages off for a moment, stitches and bruises ahoy!
