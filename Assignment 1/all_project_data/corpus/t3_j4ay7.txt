I posted last night, but perhaps it was a bit too late in the evening? I have zero funds, no food to speak of, and I've been hungry for days now. I was in a car accident a week ago and life has been pretty crummy as of late. I know this is a long shot, but anyone feel like helping out?

EDIT: Thanks pandyfackerlling!
