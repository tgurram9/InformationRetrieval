Hey Reddit, I'm a 20 year old female, I'm currently starving or at least it feels that way. I haven't ate anything since yesterday morning. I tried to go to the pantry today but they aren't open until tomorrow and tomorrow I wont need help because I get my check. I work a full-time job and currently drained my savings for a car so I didn't have to ride the metro back and forth to work. 
I've been on Reddit for over a year and helped a lot of people out in r/assistance, if someone could help me out it would mean a lot, I'm currently extremely dizzy and I think it's due to the lack of food.
Please PM for proof and my real account name, I'd be glad to pay it back or pay it forward. 

Edit: If someone would still like to help I'd appreciate it, I can't pick up my check until 5PM tomorrow so it would be awesome to wake up to something. 

Thanks.
