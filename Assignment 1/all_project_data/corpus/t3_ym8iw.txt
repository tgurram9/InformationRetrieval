Today is my 1 year anniversary to my amazing wife. We live paycheck to paycheck and my paycheck didn't come so I can't even get her dinner. When my paycheck finally comes, I will do the right thing and fulfill 2 requests on this sub-reddit. Cheers to paying it forward!

EDIT:  Thank you Threedice!  We will be sure to mention your kindness when paying it forward in the next few days!
