I was going to request a pizza for tonight, I've been in money trouble and waiting on two jobs to call back, but unemployed till then. But I'm a college student and I can still eat reliably so if you looked at this post and considered sending me a pizza, **send it to one of those folks who has people to support!**

**Edit: Okay you guys convinced me, thank you NYGalz! :)**
