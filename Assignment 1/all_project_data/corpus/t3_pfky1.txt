Random poem for a random pizza and a random day....
 
 

* At work so busy all day, No time to eat gotta run can't stay! 

* On my way home tummy starts to grumble, as my engine starts to putter and rumble.

* Oh no I need gas I say to myself. Have to reach for the pizza money up on the top shelf. 

* Not rich, nor poor. I walked into the house like every man through the front door. 

* I sit and look at whats on my desk, load up a bowl and take a deep breath. 

* After a hit I see in the corner a fresh new wrapped game.. Maybe a gift for a foreigner!!!!

* I log onto reddit and draw up a post, I decided a contest is what I should host.

* RandomActsOfGaming is where it has been layed. For 36 hours is where it will have stayed.

* Post completed happy with myself, A pizza is what I want I look to my shelf.

* Oh that's right I spent it on gas, and the rest of my money has to last.

* Oh well no worries what can you do, should not have got the extra super jumbo sized corn dog thing while high at the zoo. So random acts of pizza I turn to you

* I am not down on my luck or feeling blue. Others deserve it more then me this is true. 

* But if you find it in your heart to warm mine up tonight, I will surely do the same on first paychecks light.

**Edit 1:** I am not selfish oh no I am not, little ceases pizza 5 dollars OH I FORGOT. I have scavenged for changed and less I have found! 5 dollars worth of stuff enough for the crown. So now I leave to go get one my self. With the gas I bought for my pizza money shelf.

Thanks everyone Please skip this RAOP as I have figured out a way to achieve my craving. As that's whats RAOP is all about.... That pizza craving!
