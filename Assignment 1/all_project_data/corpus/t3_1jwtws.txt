I've never done this before, sorry if I'm breaking some rules, though I'm pretty sure I got it all correct.

My 3 year old daughter never really asks for specific meals, so I was surprised that she asked for pizza this morning. I've already done our shopping, and I don't have the supplies to make any, and our food budget is depleted.  

Anyone out there feel like making a family's night? We're a family of four, though the little one is only 16 months old, so he doesn't eat THAT much :-)

Got a verification code if that is required. 

Thanks a ton for reading!
