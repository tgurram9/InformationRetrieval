My roommate and i have fallen on some hard times lately, nothing to bad, mostly money problems. I spend a lot of time with my girlfriend, cooking for us most of the time at her house. I havent been the best friend to him lately, and i know he would really enjoy a piece of pie from some random stranger on the internet! Dang, just getting a bit choked up thinking about him getting a random pizza. Anyways, if anyone is up for a Random_Act_Of_Pizza, feel free to PM me! AMA you want, i will be here for a little while.
EDIT: Roommate went for an interview this morning clear across town, used our last 14 dollars (change) to get him there. i know he would really enjoy a pizza today, if anyone is still around to send him one! Thanks again -
