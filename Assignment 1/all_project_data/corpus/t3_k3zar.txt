Just got off a 14 hour day courtesy of the holiday weekend, and my wife is at my sisters house for her baby shower. New appartment, so no food i know how to cook, and she is still waitin on a transfer to the local kroger so we've been short her check for two weeks.

I figure someone out in the houston area that enjoy's their beer wouldn't mind helping out a hungry guy who spent all day filling up shelves with budweiser to keep all you drunks out there happy :)

*EDIT* Pizza recieved courtesy of http://www.reddit.com/user/ninjaliwa in his offer thread, in which he was generous enough to send some to several people, so many thanks to him from everyone it looks like he ended up sending pizza to
