I'm whoring my career in the Army i hopes that someone out there will send me some pizza. I'm finally able to get back on a computer after almost a year of traveling and I'm settling in to my new home at Fort Bliss in Texas. I'm new to this area and I'm hungry. Anyone want to help out a soldier?

edit: thing2thatiam is helping me out. Thanks everyone for supporting us.
