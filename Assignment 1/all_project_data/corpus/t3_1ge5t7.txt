In a nutshell, 2 months ago I sold my car to cycle to work and yesterday night the rear derailleur of my Trek Madone sheared off and I crashed into a bus shelter full of kids (no kids were hurt, but they laughed). 

I have to spend my last £60 on repairs whilst nursing a bruised ego.

I only have freezer food until Friday and some pizza would go a long way to making me feel better. 


I will forward or pay back as soon as I get paid this Friday, promise.

Thanks for reading.
