Hi there Random Acts of Pizza!

So title pretty much says it. I'm broke, had a pretty terrible week, and am stuck at home hungry with nothing to do. I can go into details if you want but I don't want to post a sob story.

I DO however, have lots of scrap fabric, buttons, and time. And I'll totally make you a loveable, ugly plushy monster and ship it to you next week when I get paid if you buy me a pizza from the local pizza hut [like $15?]. I'd really appreciate it, and so would my stomach. Thanks!

Edit: Oh, yeah, I'm in Illinois.

:] 

Edit 2: Well that was fast! I'll post pics of the ugly plushy before I mail it! Thanks to user Olivertw1st! :D
