Hey yalls, I just fuond out about this reddit. I just moved to a new city via train with everything I own on my back. I have a job but I don't get paid until Friday. I'm currently renting a room from a friend while I save for an apartment. Unfortunately I don't have any money to pay him in rent, he says it's okay but I still feel guilty. I would love to surprise him with a pizza for being so awesome since I can't afford to help him out with bills. Thanks Reddit, I'll promise to pay it forward when I get paid!

EDIT: roastedbagel is awesome! Thanks again RAOP, This subreddit is the best! I know I'll be back again [as an offer-er] soon!
