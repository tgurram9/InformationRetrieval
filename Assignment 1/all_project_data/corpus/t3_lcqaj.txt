Sup RAoP?

I'm chilling in my room, listening to some music and browsing Reddit. Suddenly I get hungry, and go to the campus pub for a meatball sub and some fries. Unfortunately, due to the lower quantity of students on campus this weekend (we have a four-day weekend this week and almost everyone has gone home,) the pub's hours are different, and when I got there they were already closed. Goddamnit.

Anyway, the first thing that popped into my mind, of course, was "REDDIT," and getting back to my room, the first thing I do is jump onto my computer and go right to RAoP. Now, I'm sitting here, pretty damn hungry, listening to Ensiferum and wondering what I can do to get some delicious pizza in my belly. So here's my offer. I am willing to provide a custom funny drawing of the giver's choice in exchange for a pizza. I'm not looking for anything extravagant as far as the pizza goes, and we have a cheap local place that delivers until midnight. In exchange for said pizza, you receive said drawing. The only other food I have right now is Martin's Salt and Vinegar potato chips, and while they are delicious, they simply aren't much of a meal. Please help this broke sophomore get himself some 'zza?

Help me Random Acts of Pizza, you're my only hope!

EDIT: ANARCHYREIGNS, YOU ROCK! Thanks for the pizza!
