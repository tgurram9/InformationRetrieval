Here it is, the first of the month.  My bills are paid off, I'm in minimal debt, and once again both my mother and my ex-girlfriend haven't paid me back.  I have some rice and a can of green beans, and hot sauce.  If I could collect interest or force them to pay, I would, but I'm just not the kind of guy to stress the important ladies in my life just so I can enjoy a small luxury of life; so I'm asking YOUUU!

I don't have much to give in return, but I'm a fairly decent wordsmith and I do still have some l3375k1ll5 online, so I can even play something with you if you're that bored, or write you something.  My senior humanities project was a Star Trek fan script, fyi.

Thanks in advance to all whom at least read this lone whimper in a sea of screams.
