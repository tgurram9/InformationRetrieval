Hey all.

I fractured my ankle in 3 places Friday night, and am currently stuck in my bed on pain medication with no easily accessible food. None of my roommates are home until later tonight, and I am absolutely starving! I am not working at the moment due to my fractured ankle, so I am trying to save as much money as possible to pay for my bills, etc..

I would really appreciate some pizza right now! I will be sure to return the favor when I am in better fortunes.

Thank you so much!
