On 07/17/11 at 11:30 My wifey and I became parents for the first time.  We were not in great financial standing to begin with, but I have done everything I could over the last few months to buy things to have us ready for the baby, and everything is doing great there.

However, wifey is already starting to feel the post-partum depression setting in.  She feels like we will never be able to enjoy life again because money is a little tight right now.  We both have jobs, etc. so things will be better.  However the tastiest food we have had is Hamburger Helper made with 70/30 beef in the past week and a half.

And so, a random pizza would be great...

TL;DR New Baby, The mother is depressed because we are eating out of cans already, trying to lift her spirits.

Can provide proof of everything above.
