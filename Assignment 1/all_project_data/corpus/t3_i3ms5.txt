Hey all. I'm a nineteen year old college student, home for summer break and at home in New Jersey for fathers day with my two younger brothers. My mom drew short straws and is working on this Sunday/holiday, and my dad doesn't live with us anymore.

The house is almost bare and my mom won't be back until late evening, so I was wondering if there were any redditors out there willing to help my brothers and I out with a pizza for lunch/dinner to give this drab Sunday of ours a defining, yummy meal.

Thanks for reading! and have a great father's day all.
