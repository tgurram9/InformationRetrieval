Just got my first job out of college and it's actually out of the country (Brazil). It actually starts in October so still a bit of time to wait. Just need to get the specific type of Visa required etc. Anyway I want to celebrate but lack the funds. A pizza would be great! In the DC Area.

Edit: Got the pizza, thanks quiethero!
