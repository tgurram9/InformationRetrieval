Hello :)

My adorable puppy (pic - http://i.imgur.com/n8OC9.jpg ) and I kindly ask that someone please hook us up with a pizza today.  I'm broke, hungry, and I get paid tomorrow. 


I will most certainly buy you or another redditor(your choice) a pizza tomorrow .

A pizza and a Dr. Pepper would totally rock my world, but a pizza alone would be just as wonderful. 

In the time it has taken me to write this post, she's become much more demanding: http://i.imgur.com/2pY2v.jpg &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;


Please save me from her wrath and send us a Pizza! I solemnly promise to return the favor tomorrow :)

Edit: I'll also be happy to send/post pics of the pizza and us enjoying it :D
