I really hate asking for handouts and if I wasn't married, I probably wouldn't bother. But yesterday, I got laid off. Not only did I not get any severance pay, my boss also gave me a 1-week, mandatory, unpaid "vacation" prior to the layoff. 

They had told me to "enjoy a week off for Thanksgiving and spend time with your family." That was nice, I figured my Christmas bonus will make up for the 40-hour loss. Then I come back ready to work, 2 days later I get the boot. Keep in mind, this is 2 weeks before Christmas bonuses go out. 

So I lost 1 week of pay, no severance, no bonus, and no job. My wife is a full-time college student that isn't even allowed to work (she will lose her scholarships.)

This is going to be a very tight and hungry Christmas for my wife and I. And we would greatly appreciate something good to eat so I can use what money I have left to pay bills until I find another job.

If you need proof, I'd be happy to tell you anything. We are a very generous couple and once I get another job, I would be happy to pay it forward.
