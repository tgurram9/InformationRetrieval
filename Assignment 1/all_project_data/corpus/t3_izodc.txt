Hey guys my name is Dwight I live in Kula, Hawaii and would like to have some pizza tonight or sometime this week. Last Friday I found out my dad's house which I live at is being foreclosed on. I didn't even know that that was going to happen. I'm pretty broke and I would really like a pizza if you guys are ok with giving me one. Ask me anything and thanks you guys are awesome!
Edit: Just got a gift card from Paulinator. Thank you all so Much!
