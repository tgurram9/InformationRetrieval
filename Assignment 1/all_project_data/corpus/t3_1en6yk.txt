Living in SD, USA. Money is really tight with my fiance and I and while we have cheap boxed dinner food it would be much appreciated to be able to offer her something more substantial to eat since she's 7 months pregnant. If anybody is feeling generous we would be eternally thankful! 

EDIT: Fulfilled by pizzamom thank you so much!
