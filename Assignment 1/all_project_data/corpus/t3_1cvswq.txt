I am a very happy wife and mother to four children. We just moved which is killing our finances. We are constantly struggling with making it from day to day. I work full time plus overtime.....but I work for salary so the overtime is moot. My husband is struggling with a decision to go through the disability process at such a young age, or to work on a knee that desperately needs surgery but he doesn't have insurance. Applying for disability is a long process and I don't know if we can wait much longer. Anyway, I'd be happy to make it the next couple of days. We are blessed with a little help from food stamps and we have a very generous local pantry. However we're hungry now and the food stamps are long gone, mainly due to a refrigerator that stopped working and spoiled $100 worth of food. (Really hard to stretch $250 over a month's time for a family of 6). We will get pantry food on Wednesday and they even provide clothes. Just need a little help to get by for a couple of days.

EDIT: I'm speechless. [sumpinlikedat](http://www.reddit.com/user/sumpinlikedat) responded immediately when I was being down voted and not expecting even a comment. Looking at the history this is a very kind and generous person. Thank you so much!! Our little ones are going to be so excited tonight!
