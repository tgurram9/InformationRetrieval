Hello Reddit, 

I won't be getting any money until Wednesday and our fridge is bare. My wife and I would really appreciate a pizza if possible. I know others might need it more, but if possible we would really appreciate it. As soon as I land a job (2 prospects in the works) I would love to pay it forward of course. Anything to get a slice next to my name :P jk

Thanks Reddit and Redditors for all the laughs. 

Edit:1 Thank you Gingaskunk! I will pay it forward as soon as I can!
