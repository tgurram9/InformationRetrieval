My best friend's not eaten all day or yesterday and is feeling sick. I've got no money, or I'd help him, and he's across the country with no way of getting anything to eat. I'm really worried about him because this happens frequently, and he gets sick because of it. If someone could get him a gift card, I would be eternally grateful. I can draw you a picture of Pinkie Pie, because that's the only thing I can draw. He's in California in the Orange County area

EDIT - Thank you, anonymous gifter!
