Hey

My girlfriend and I have been sick all week( stomach bug) 

We would love a pizza as we don't really have the energy to cook right now. Or the funds to order.

It would be really helpful, would order forward or return the favour after pay day. 


Thanks for reading

Edit:

No longer needed, my brother turned up with a pizza and a few beers :) thanks anyway guys!
