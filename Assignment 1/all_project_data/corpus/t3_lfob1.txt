Just checking this out, I've been consumed by Reddit recently and am now branching out into the subreddits (does this count as one? lol Im new to all of this). 

Not really a sob story but hey Ill tell you whats up in my life right now. I live with my gf of 4 years in a modest apartment in some suburb in between Dallas and Fort Worth. In May I was laid off by Best Buy when they closed the facility I was working in and moved it to Kentucky. I have been on unemployment since and have been finding it a might difficult to find a job that will allow me to pay my current bills better than unemployment can. I've gone to college on and off since graduating high school in 03 (if you had asked me then if id be be a college-dropout on unemployment 8 years later...I would've called you nuts) I suppose this is how life goes. 

I'm not sure if this is too long of a post for this and I apologize if it is!

if I don't end up getting pizza, that's all good.. I understand that there may be someone in a more grave situation and by all means I would love for them to get it before I. 

EDIT: OH! I'm an artist so I would be willing to draw any random thing for free pizza (dont expect it to be like mind-blowingly amazing but I will definitely try to make it cool!) if interest is shown in that avenue, I can link to my photobucket to show my style and see if there is still an interest. thanks all!
