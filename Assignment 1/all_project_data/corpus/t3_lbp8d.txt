So my story... I'm a university student, busy doing homework, lectures and reddit.  I had to cut my work hours down to the times I was available due to school and I've been getting an average of 4 hours a week... ($10.25/hr).

I've been having problems with having enough money to even bring a lunch at school and I've been pretty much free-loading off of my buddy.  I'm just looking for some nice person to help me out so I can treat him back for all the times he's bought me food.  Thank you for taking the time to read my story.

EDIT: I forgot to mention location: Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada.

Thanks again to anyone who might consider. :)
